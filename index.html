		<h1> Hello! </h1>
		<p> I graduated from Carnegie Mellon in May 2014 and I now work for Yale's User Experience and Web Services Team. My amazing team helps migrate old sites to newer CMS platforms and provides excellent consultative services to their clients. As the UX and UI designer, I help design the layouts of our client's websites to match their mission and their user's needs. In my spare time, I enjoy learning more about various programming languages and better user research methods.
